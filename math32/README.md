# math32

One of the annoyances of Go is that its standard math library does only float64 arithmetic.
Since Go has no implicit numerical conversions, using that library for 32-bit work is tedious.  

The library here corresponds to only a subset of the standard library.  It includes only what 
Frequon Invaders needs.  If there is ever a Bessel Function Invaders, maybe I'll add more.
