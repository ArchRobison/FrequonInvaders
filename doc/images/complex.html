<P>
A complex number <EM>x</EM>+<EM>y</EM>i has two parts: 
a <EM>real</EM> part <EM>x</EM> and an <EM>imaginary</EM> part.  
The symbol i denotes the square root of -1.
For purposes of this game, you can think of <EM>x</EM> and <EM>y</EM> 
as coordinates on a 2D plane, like this:

This is called the ``complex plane''.
A complex number can also be represented by polar coordinates, like this:
<CENTER> <IMAGE SRC="polar.png"> </CENTER>
The <EM>magnitude</EM> is the distance from the origin.  
The <EM>phase</EM> is the angle with the positive real axis.
<P>
In the game, your ``self'' is a point in the complex plane.  
The Fourier Transform converts this point to a wave pattern of complex numbers,
displayed as colors.  
The ``Radar'' portion of the display shows the color of the numbers in
the complex plane.  For example, in the default ``complex'' coloring, the
phase is shown by color, and the magnitude by brightness.
In the ``magnitude'' coloring (grey), the numbers are colored shades
of grey based solely on their magnitudes.
<P>
The angular sweep-and-fade of the radar is for show only.  
The coloring within the Fourier portion of the display does not fade likewise.
